### Skills and Experience aqcuired from work, projects completed while studying at university, and selfstudy


* I’m currently working as The Lead Teacher for Physics and have previously worked in other projects. I have experience 
  in the  following area
* Data wrangling is the process of cleaning data for the purposes of data analysis, machine learning and visualization to 
  gain  actionable insights. I used python and pandas to clean messy data sets. Further developing skills on
    Importing and parsing data in CSV, XML and JSON format;
    Cleaning and auditing data for accuracy, consistency, correct types, and missing values; and
    Reshaping data to communicate results better with team members.
    
  * Literature search for one-bond, two-bond and three-bond separated atoms (spins) coupling values
  
  * Literature search for vicinal coupling values for backbone and sidechain dihedral angles for proteins and nucleic acids
  
  * Computing Karplus coefficients from vicinal coupling values and dihedral angles for the backbone and sidechain 
    dihedrals for   proteins and nucleic acids
  
  * Running computational chemistry methods: DFT and Hartree Fock theories
  
  * Using computational chemistry packages such as Gaussian and Molden
  
  * Running molecular dynamics package: Gromacs, to compute the hessian of a chemical and/or biological system
  
  * Writing Matlab codes or scripts for scientific software development
  
  * Working with Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) files to extract data for simulation work
 
  * Simulating NMR spectra and fitting data from theory to data from experiment
 
  * Preparation of posters and slides for presentation using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop
  
  * Use of PyMOL and VMD – for visualization and analysis of biologically important molecules
  
  * Also use of scientific graphing and exploratory &amp; statistical data analysis tool (OriginLab) to analyze data
  
  * Present my data and findings both in a poster and seminar form within my institution and regional conferences and workshops.


 * I’m currently been trained as a Data Scientist using python on a Bootcamp designed and provided by HyperioDev in partnership 
   with the Department for Education. The program is competetive and I have been selected from a large pool of applicants.
   
   
 * I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science projects so feel free to reach out!
