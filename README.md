### Hi there 👋
<!--
**Zenawi777/Zenawi777** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as The Lead Teacher for Physics and have previously worked in other projects and have experience in the following area
     Data wrangling is the process of cleaning data for the purposes of data analysis, machine learning and visualization to gain actionable
     insights. I used python and pandas to clean messy data sets. Further developing skills on
        o Importing and parsing data in CSV, XML and JSON format;
        o Cleaning and auditing data for accuracy, consistency, correct types, and missing values; and
        o Reshaping data to communicate results better with team members.
    
    Literature search for one-bond, two-bond and three-bond separated atoms (spins) coupling values
   Literature search for vicinal coupling values for backbone and sidechain dihedral angles for proteins and nucleic acids
   Computing Karplus coefficients from vicinal coupling values and dihedral angles for the backbone and sidechain dihedrals for proteins and nucleic acids
   Running computational chemistry methods: DFT and Hartree Fock theories
   Using computational chemistry packages such as Gaussian and Molden
   Running molecular dynamics package: Gromacs, to compute the hessian of a chemical and/or biological system
   Writing Matlab codes or scripts for scientific software development
   Working with Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) files to extract data for simulation work
   Simulating NMR spectra and fitting data from theory to data from experiment
   Preparation of posters and slides for presentation using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop
   Use of PyMOL and VMD – for visualization and analysis of biologically important molecules
   Also use of scientific graphing and exploratory &amp; statistical data analysis tool (OriginLab) to analyze data
   Present my data and findings both in a poster and seminar form within my institution and regional conferences and workshops...
